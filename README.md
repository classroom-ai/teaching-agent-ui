# AI-Powered Learning Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS) designed to revolutionize the educational experience. Our goal is to create an interactive and adaptive learning environment where AI agents act as personalized tutors, teaching students across various subjects. The system aims to provide dynamic content, immediate feedback, and tailored learning paths to enhance student engagement and comprehension.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. We are in the initial phases of building the core AI agent functionalities, integrating learning content, and developing the user interface. While significant progress is being made, the system is not yet ready for production use.

## Key Features (Under Construction)

*   **AI Teaching Agents:** Intelligent agents capable of delivering lessons, answering questions, and providing explanations.
*   **Personalized Learning Paths:** Adaptive curriculum adjusted to individual student progress and learning styles.
*   **Interactive Quizzes & Assessments:** AI-generated quizzes and real-time evaluation of student understanding.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Detailed analytics and insights into student performance and growth.
*   **Rich Content Integration:** Support for various media types (text, video, interactive elements) to create engaging lessons.

## Technologies Used (Planned/Current)

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js (or similar, if specified later)
*   **AI/ML:** OpenAI Agents (or other relevant AI frameworks/APIs)
*   **Database:** (To be determined - e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

## Getting Started (Development)
